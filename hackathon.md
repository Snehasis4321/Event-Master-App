## Description of Project

Event Master is an event planning and managing app, where users can create their account and host new events in desired locations and a specific date and time and also rsvp existing events. They can also track and modify and update their event from settings. This app has and clean ui and it is built using Flutter. We use Appwrite as our backend database throughout this project for authentication, database and image storage.

## Tech Stack

1. [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) -
    
    I have used Flutter for the front-end part of my app it lets me build a cool and amazing ui using material design.
    
2. [Appwrite Cloud](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) -
    
    I have used appwrite in this project cause it is open source and it has a lot of features like storage, auth, database, functions. I also have a great SDK for Flutter which help me complete my work faster.
    
    Some Features I used in my project -
    
    * Authentication
        
        I have use the Email/Password auth method for my project that lets every user create a new account and login into their existing account.
        
    * Database
        
        I have used appwrite databases and created several collections of users and events for storing the user's data and events data respectively. And perform operations on them like create read update and delete on the collections.
        
    * Storage
        
        I have used appwrite storage and created a new bucket where I add all the images of events when a user publishes any event.
        

## Challenges Faced

Since appwrite cloud uses version 1.1.2 i miss all the new features, especially relationships and new query operators. It would have reduced some lines of code.
